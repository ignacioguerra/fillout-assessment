# Page Navigation Component (Fillout Assessment)

A polished, accessible page-navigation UI built for Fillout's Senior Frontend Engineer take-home challenge.

## What I Built

- View a series of form pages (e.g., "Info", "Details", "Other", "Ending")
- Drag to re-order pages
- Add a new page between any two existing pages via a "+" button on hover
- Open a context menu per page (rename, duplicate, delete â€” delete is functional)
- Highlight the active page and select other pages
- Navigate the UI fully with the keyboard for accessibility

## Tech Stack

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **[dnd kit](https://dndkit.com/)** (for sortable drag-and-drop)
